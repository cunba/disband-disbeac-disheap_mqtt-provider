  title: Disband - Disbeac MQTT API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: >
    The Disband - disbeac API allows you to remotely manage the disband and
    disbeac.

    ### Features:

    * Recieve real-time information about enviromental pressure, humidity,
    lightning and noise

    * Recieve real-time information about a particular person heart-rate

    * Pair disband and disbeac with a particular app account

    * Recieve real-time information about the location of a particular disbeac

    * Synchronize the disband with the configuration provided by the app

    * Get to know if a particular disbeac is active

    * Make vibrate the disband
